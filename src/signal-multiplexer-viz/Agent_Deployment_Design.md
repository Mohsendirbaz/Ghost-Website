# Agent Deployment Design: Dual-Purpose Signal Processing

## Module-Level Objective

**Harness agentic computational power** through dynamic agent routing and resource allocation for dual-purpose signal processing across specific function and public utility channels.

---

## Core Design Philosophy

This system treats **agents as computational resources** that must be optimally deployed to handle two distinct signal types:

1. **Specific Function Signals** (Complete Sets): Known operations requiring deterministic processing
2. **Public Utility Signals** (Incomplete Sets): Partially known processes requiring adaptable handling

The routing and allocation decisions are **learned functions** of bandwidth availability and signal complexity, with agent count and LLM engine strength as **manipulative variables** adjusted based on performance metrics.

---

## Agent Routing Framework

### Decision Variables

**Manipulative Variables** (System Controls):
- `N_i`: Number of agents allocated to channel `i`
- `S_i`: LLM engine strength for agents on channel `i` (e.g., context window, reasoning capability)
- `R_ij`: Routing fraction of agent `j` to specific (vs public) signal handling

**Learnable Parameters**:
- `C_specific(i)`: Complexity cost function for specific signals on channel `i`
- `C_public(i)`: Complexity cost function for public signals on channel `i`
- `η_i`: Learning rate for complexity estimation on channel `i`

**Observable Variables** (Disturbance/Feedback):
- `P_i`: Performance metrics (throughput, latency, success rate) for channel `i`
- `B_i`: Bandwidth allocation for channel `i`
- `Q_specific(i)`: Queue depth of specific function signals
- `Q_public(i)`: Queue depth of public utility signals

---

## Optimization Problem Formulation

### Objective Function

```
minimize: Σ_i [N_i × (C_specific(i) × Q_specific(i) + C_public(i) × Q_public(i))] / B_i
          + λ × Σ_i (S_i × cost_strength_i)  // LLM strength cost
          - γ × Σ_i P_i                        // Performance reward
```

**Terms**:
- **Agent workload cost**: Number of agents × complexity-weighted queue depths, normalized by bandwidth
- **LLM strength cost**: Computational cost of more powerful engines (parameter λ controls trade-off)
- **Performance reward**: Negative term to maximize performance metrics (parameter γ controls importance)

### Constraints

```
Constraints:
1. Agent capacity:    Σ_i N_i ≤ N_total_available
2. Bandwidth budget:  Σ_i B_i ≤ B_total
3. Minimum service:   N_i ≥ N_min_i based on priority
4. LLM strength bounds: S_i ∈ [S_min, S_max]
5. Routing validity:  0 ≤ R_ij ≤ 1, Σ_j R_ij = 1
```

## Learnable Complexity Model

### Complexity Cost Functions

The complexity costs are **learned online** from observed processing patterns:

```javascript
// Specific function complexity (initially known, refined over time)
C_specific(i, t) = α_0 + α_1 × signal_size + α_2 × dependency_depth

// Public utility complexity (initially uncertain, learned from data)
C_public(i, t) = β_0 + β_1 × uncertainty_level + β_2 × variance_estimate
```

### Learning Mechanism

**Online gradient descent** on observed agent processing times:

```
ΔC(i) = η_i × (τ_observed - τ_predicted) × ∇C
```

Where:
- `τ_observed`: Actual agent processing time
- `τ_predicted`: Predicted time based on current complexity model
- `η_i`: Per-channel learning rate

### Uncertainty Quantification

For public utility signals (incomplete sets), maintain **epistemic uncertainty bounds**:

```javascript
uncertaintyMetrics: {
  complexityMean: μ_C,           // Mean estimated complexity
  complexityVariance: σ²_C,      // Uncertainty in complexity estimate
  credibleInterval: [μ - 2σ, μ + 2σ], // 95% confidence bounds
  sampleCount: n                 // Observations used for estimation
}
```

As more signals are processed, `n` increases and `σ²_C` decreases (uncertainty reduction).

---

## Agent Allocation Strategy

### Dynamic Allocation Algorithm

```
For each optimization cycle (100ms):

1. OBSERVE:
   - Current queue depths Q_specific(i), Q_public(i)
   - Current performance metrics P_i
   - Current bandwidth allocations B_i

2. ESTIMATE COMPLEXITY:
   - Update C_specific(i) and C_public(i) using recent observations
   - Calculate uncertainty bounds for C_public(i)

3. FORMULATE PROBLEM:
   - Construct optimization problem with current state
   - Include learned complexity costs in objective

4. SOLVE:
   - Compute optimal N_i (agent count per channel)
   - Compute optimal S_i (LLM strength per channel)
   - Compute optimal R_ij (routing fractions)

5. APPLY:
   - Adjust agent deployment across channels
   - Reconfigure LLM engine parameters
   - Update routing tables

6. RECORD:
   - Store performance metrics for learning
   - Update complexity model parameters
```

## Agent Architecture

### Agent Specification

Each agent is characterized by:

```javascript
Agent: {
  id: string,
  assignedChannel: string,
  llmStrength: {
    contextWindow: number,      // e.g., 4K, 32K, 128K tokens
    reasoningDepth: number,     // e.g., 1-10 chain-of-thought steps
    toolAccess: string[]        // Available tools for processing
  },
  routingWeight: {
    specificSignals: 0.0-1.0,   // Fraction handling specific
    publicSignals: 0.0-1.0      // Fraction handling public
  },
  performanceMetrics: {
    throughput: number,          // Signals/second
    accuracy: number,            // Success rate
    latency: number              // Average processing time
  }
}
```

### LLM Strength Levels

Define discrete LLM strength levels as manipulative variable:

```javascript
LLM_STRENGTH_LEVELS = {
  'MINIMAL': {
    contextWindow: 4096,
    reasoningDepth: 1,
    costMultiplier: 1.0
  },
  'STANDARD': {
    contextWindow: 32768,
    reasoningDepth: 3,
    costMultiplier: 4.0
  },
  'ENHANCED': {
    contextWindow: 131072,
    reasoningDepth: 7,
    costMultiplier: 16.0
  }
}
```

Agents on channels with high complexity signals are allocated stronger LLMs.

## Performance-Based Adaptation

### Disturbance Variables as Feedback

**Performance metrics act as disturbance signals** that drive adaptation:

```javascript
PerformanceMetrics: {
  throughput_i: signals_processed / time,
  latency_i: avg_processing_time,
  successRate_i: successful_signals / total_signals,
  complexityError_i: |τ_observed - τ_predicted|
}
```

### Adaptive Control Loop

```
IF performance_i < threshold:
  IF complexityError_i > tolerance:
    // Model mismatch - increase learning rate
    η_i ← η_i × 1.2
  ELSE:
    // Insufficient resources - increase allocation
    N_i ← N_i + 1
    OR S_i ← next_higher_strength_level(S_i)
    
IF performance_i > target × 1.2:
  // Over-allocated - reduce resources
  N_i ← max(N_min_i, N_i - 1)
  OR S_i ← next_lower_strength_level(S_i)
```

## Dual-Purpose Processing Paths

### Specific Function Path

**Characteristics**:
- Deterministic processing with known algorithms
- Low complexity variance (σ²_C ≈ 0)
- Agents use template-based processing
- Minimal LLM strength required

**Agent Assignment**:
```
N_specific(i) = ceil(Q_specific(i) × C_specific(i) / (B_i × efficiency_factor))
```

### Public Utility Path

**Characteristics**:
- Adaptive processing for unknown patterns
- High complexity variance (σ²_C > 0)
- Agents use reasoning and inference
- Variable LLM strength based on uncertainty

**Agent Assignment**:
```
N_public(i) = ceil(Q_public(i) × (C_public(i) + k × σ_C(i)) / (B_i × efficiency_factor))
```

Where `k` is a safety margin coefficient accounting for uncertainty.

### Convergence Point

Both paths merge at a **quality-weighted aggregation node**:

```javascript
ConvergenceMetrics: {
  totalProcessed: N_specific_processed + N_public_processed,
  weightedQuality: (
    N_specific_processed × Q_specific_quality +
    N_public_processed × Q_public_quality × confidence_weight
  ) / totalProcessed,
  resourceEfficiency: totalProcessed / (Σ N_i)
}
```

4. **Disturbance Feedback**: Performance metrics drive continuous adaptation
5. **Dual-Purpose Optimization**: Balances specific function efficiency with public utility robustness

## Mathematical Summary

**State Vector**: `x = [N_1, ..., N_n, S_1, ..., S_n, R_11, ..., R_nm]`

**Cost Function**: `J(x) = workload_cost + strength_cost - performance_reward`

**Dynamics**: `x(t+1) = x(t) + Δx` where `Δx = solve_optimization(J, constraints)`

**Learning**: `C(t+1) = C(t) + η × gradient_estimate`

**Adaptation**: `η(t+1) = adapt_learning_rate(performance_error(t))`

This formulation enables the system to **harness agentic computational power** by treating agents as first-class resources optimally allocated through continuous problem reformulation and learning.
