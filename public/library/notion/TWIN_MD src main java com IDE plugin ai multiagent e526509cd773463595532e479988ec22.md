# ArchitectAgent Class Documentation

## Overview
`ArchitectAgent` is a specialized agent responsible for system design, architectural decisions, and high-level planning within the multi-agent system. It handles design pattern recommendations, architecture reviews, system analysis, and maintains a knowledge base of design patterns and architectural styles. This agent serves as the technical architect, ensuring system coherence and design quality.

### System Analysis Framework
- **Scope**: Comprehensive system-wide analysis
- **Integration**: Shares findings with Observer and Code Editor agents
- **Storage**: Maintains architecture repository for future reference
- **Broadcasting**: Critical findings distributed to relevant agents

## Component Props and Data Structures

### Core Collections
```java
private final Map<String, DesignPattern> knownPatterns      // Pattern repository
private final Map<String, SystemArchitecture> architectures // Architecture storage
private final Queue<DesignProposal> proposalHistory        // Historical proposals
private final Set<String> activeProjects                   // Currently monitored projects
```

### Key Inner Classes

### DesignProposal

```java
private static class DesignProposal {    private final String projectId;    private SystemArchitecture architecture;    private List<DesignPattern> recommendedPatterns;    private Map<String, Component> componentStructure;}
```

### DesignPattern

```java
private static class DesignPattern {    private final String name;      // Pattern identifier    private final String category;  // Pattern classification}
```

### SystemArchitecture Enum

```java
private enum SystemArchitecture {    MONOLITHIC,    // Single deployment unit    LAYERED,       // N-tier architecture    MICROSERVICES, // Distributed services    EVENT_DRIVEN,  // Event-based communication    HEXAGONAL      // Ports and adapters}
```

## Usage Patterns and Integration Points

### Design Request Flow

```java
// Incoming design requestMessage designRequest = {    type: DESIGN_REQUEST,    payload: {        projectId: "project-123",        requirements: {            functional: ["user-auth", "data-processing"],            nonFunctional: ["high-scalability", "fault-tolerance"]        }    }};// ArchitectAgent processes and responds with:Message designProposal = {    type: DESIGN_PROPOSAL,    payload: {        projectId: "project-123",        proposal: DesignProposal,        patterns: [CircuitBreaker, ServiceRegistry],        architecture: MICROSERVICES
    }};
```

### Architecture Review Process

```java
// Review requestMessage reviewRequest = {    type: ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW,    payload: {        projectId: "project-456",        architecture: currentArchitecture
    }};// Review responseMessage reviewResult = {    type: REVIEW_RESULT,    payload: {        review: ArchitectureReview,        improvements: ["Add caching layer", "Implement circuit breakers"],        riskAssessment: RiskAssessment
    }};
```

### Pattern Suggestion Workflow

```java
// Pattern request based on contextMessage patternRequest = {    type: PATTERN_SUGGESTION,    payload: {        context: "distributed-communication",        constraints: ["low-latency", "high-reliability"]    }};// Suggested patterns with rationaleMessage patternRecommendation = {    type: PATTERN_RECOMMENDATION,    payload: {        patterns: [PublishSubscribe, CircuitBreaker],        rationale: "Selected for reliability and decoupling"    }};
```

## Architecture Selection Logic

### Decision Tree

1. **High Scalability Required** â†’ MICROSERVICES
2. **Real-time Processing** â†’ EVENT_DRIVEN
3. **Complex Business Logic (>20 features)** â†’ LAYERED
4. **Simple Requirements** â†’ MONOLITHIC
5. **Clean Architecture Focus** â†’ HEXAGONAL

### Pattern Matching Rules

- **MICROSERVICES** â†’ ServiceRegistry, CircuitBreaker patterns
- **EVENT_DRIVEN** â†’ Observer, PublishSubscribe patterns
- **LAYERED** â†’ Repository, ServiceLayer patterns
- **HEXAGONAL** â†’ Port, Adapter patterns

## Best Practices and Considerations

### Design Philosophy

1. **Requirements-Driven**: All decisions based on explicit requirements
2. **Pattern Appropriateness**: Only recommend patterns that solve real problems
3. **Evolutionary Design**: Support for architecture evolution over time
4. **Risk Awareness**: All proposals include risk assessments

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Async Processing**: All analysis operations are non-blocking
2. **History Tracking**: Maintain audit trail of all design decisions
3. **Collaborative Design**: Integrate feedback from other agents
4. **Continuous Learning**: Update pattern knowledge base based on outcomes

### Trust-Based Adjustments

- **HIGH Trust**: Accept proposals with minimal validation
- **MEDIUM Trust**: Standard review process
- **LOW Trust**: Require additional validation and peer review

### Performance Considerations

1. **Analysis Parallelism**: Use thread pool for concurrent analysis
2. **Caching Strategy**: Cache architecture evaluations for efficiency
3. **Proposal Reuse**: Leverage historical proposals for similar requirements

### Common Architectural Patterns

### Microservices Selection Criteria

- High scalability requirements
- Independent deployment needs
- Multiple development teams
- Varying technology stacks

### Event-Driven Selection Criteria

- Real-time processing requirements
- Loose coupling between components
- Asynchronous communication needs
- Event sourcing requirements

### Layered Architecture Selection Criteria

- Clear separation of concerns
- Traditional enterprise applications
- Well-defined business logic layers
- Standardized technology stack

### Integration Points

1. **With ObserverAgent**: Receives system analysis data
2. **With CodeEditorAgent**: Provides architectural constraints
3. **With Trust System**: Adjusts validation based on trust levels
4. **With Event Bus**: Broadcasts critical design decisions

### Error Handling

- **Invalid Requirements**: Graceful degradation to safe defaults
- **Pattern Conflicts**: Resolution through priority rules
- **Analysis Failures**: Fallback to cached recommendations
- **Communication Errors**: Retry with exponential backoff
