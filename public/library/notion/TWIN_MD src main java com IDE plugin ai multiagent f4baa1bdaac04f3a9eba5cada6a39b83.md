# MechanicalSignalAnalyzer

## Overview
Analyzes signal patterns for optimization and anomaly detection in the mechanical signaling system. This component provides comprehensive analysis capabilities with a focus on pattern recognition, performance optimization, and anomaly detection.

## Class Description
`MechanicalSignalAnalyzer` implements a sophisticated analysis framework that operates on mechanical signals to identify patterns, optimize performance, and detect anomalies. The analyzer uses a multi-threaded approach with scheduled periodic analysis for continuous system improvement.

## Logic Distribution
- **40%** Pattern Analysis
- **30%** Performance Optimization
- **30%** Anomaly Detection

## Key Components

### Core Components
- **SignalPatternDetector**: Identifies patterns in signal behavior
- **PerformanceOptimizer**: Finds optimization opportunities
- **AnomalyDetector**: Detects unusual signal characteristics
- **signalMetrics**: Concurrent map storing metrics per agent
- **analysisExecutor**: Thread pool for parallel analysis
- **scheduledExecutor**: Scheduled tasks for periodic analysis

### Threading Model
- Fixed thread pool (4 threads) for analysis tasks
- Scheduled thread pool (2 threads) for periodic tasks
- 30-second intervals for periodic analysis
- 100ms timeout for individual analysis operations

## Main Methods

### analyzeSignal(MechanicalSignal signal)
Performs comprehensive analysis of a single signal:
1. Updates signal metrics
2. Runs pattern detection (async)
3. Performs optimization analysis (async)
4. Executes anomaly detection (async)
5. Combines results with timeout handling
6. Generates recommendations based on findings

### performPeriodicAnalysis()
Executes scheduled analysis tasks:
- Analyzes global patterns across all agents
- Identifies system-wide optimization opportunities
- Updates anomaly detection baselines
- Generates and publishes analysis reports

## Inner Classes

### SignalPatternDetector
Detects various pattern types in signals:

#### Pattern Types
- **Frequency Patterns**: Signal transmission rates
- **Payload Patterns**: Data structure similarities
- **Temporal Patterns**: Time-based correlations

#### Methods
- `detectPatterns()`: Identifies patterns in individual signals
- `analyzeGlobalPatterns()`: Finds system-wide patterns
- Pattern-specific detection methods for each type

### PerformanceOptimizer
Identifies optimization opportunities:

#### Optimization Areas
- **Compression**: Payload size reduction
- **Routing**: Path optimization
- **Batching**: Grouping similar signals

#### Methods
- `optimize()`: Analyzes single signal optimization potential
- `identifyOpportunities()`: Finds system-wide optimizations
- Threshold-based analysis (e.g., >100 signals/sec for batching)

### AnomalyDetector
Detects abnormal signal behavior:

#### Anomaly Types
- **Payload Size**: Unusual data sizes
- **Frequency**: Abnormal transmission rates
- **Pattern**: Deviations from normal behavior

#### Methods
- `detectAnomalies()`: Checks signal against baselines
- `updateBaselines()`: Updates normal behavior models
- Baseline comparison with configurable thresholds

## Supporting Classes

### SignalMetrics
Tracks per-agent signal statistics:
- Signal count
- Total payload size
- First/last signal timestamps
- Signal rate calculation

### SignalBaseline
Maintains normal behavior baselines:
- Min/max payload sizes
- Average payload size
- Average signal rate

## Analysis Results

### SignalAnalysisResult
Contains comprehensive analysis output:
- Pattern analysis results
- Optimization recommendations
- Detected anomalies
- Generated recommendations
- Error handling for failed analysis

### Recommendation Generation
Intelligent recommendation system based on:
- Pattern detection (e.g., batch similar signals)
- Optimization potential (e.g., compression ratios)
- Anomaly counts (e.g., validation rule reviews)

## Performance Features

### Asynchronous Processing
- Parallel analysis using CompletableFuture
- Timeout handling (100ms per operation)
- Non-blocking result combination

### Resource Management
- Graceful shutdown with timeout handling
- Thread pool lifecycle management
- Memory-efficient metric storage

## Usage Example
```java
// Initialize analyzer
MechanicalSignalAnalyzer analyzer = new MechanicalSignalAnalyzer();

// Analyze a signal
MechanicalSignal signal = new MechanicalSignal(...);
SignalAnalysisResult result = analyzer.analyzeSignal(signal);

// Check results
if (result.hasPatterns()) {
    System.out.println("Patterns detected: " + result.getPatternCount());
}

if (result.hasOptimizations()) {
    System.out.println("Optimization potential: " +
        result.getOptimizationPotential() + "%");
}

if (result.hasAnomalies()) {
    System.out.println("Anomalies found: " + result.getAnomalyCount());
}

// Get recommendations
List<String> recommendations = result.getRecommendations();
recommendations.forEach(System.out::println);

// Shutdown when done
analyzer.shutdown();
```

## Integration Points

- Receives signals from validation system
- Works with `SignalValidationCoordinator`
- Publishes reports to interested components
- Updates shared baselines and metrics

## Best Practices

1. Allow analyzer to build baselines before relying on anomaly detection
2. Configure appropriate thresholds for your system
3. Monitor recommendation implementation impact
4. Regularly review global pattern reports
5. Ensure proper shutdown for resource cleanup

## Configuration Options

- Analysis timeout: 100ms (hardcoded)
- Periodic analysis interval: 30 seconds
- Thread pool sizes: 4 analysis, 2 scheduled
- High frequency threshold: 100 signals/second
- Compression threshold: 1024 bytes
- Hop count optimization: >3 hops

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning for pattern detection
- Adaptive threshold adjustment
- Real-time dashboard integration
- Custom pattern definitions
- Performance prediction models
- Integration with external monitoring tools
