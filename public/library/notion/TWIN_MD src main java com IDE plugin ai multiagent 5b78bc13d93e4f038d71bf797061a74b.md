# MechanicalSignalQueue

## Overview
Specialized queue implementation for managing mechanical signals awaiting transmission or processing.

## Purpose
The `MechanicalSignalQueue` class provides efficient queuing mechanisms for mechanical signals, supporting various queuing strategies and ensuring reliable signal delivery.

## Key Components

### Queue Features
- Priority queuing
- FIFO/LIFO support
- Bounded/unbounded queues
- Persistent queuing
- Distributed queuing

### Queue Operations
- Enqueue signal
- Dequeue signal
- Peek operations
- Batch operations
- Queue management

### Performance Features
- Lock-free operations
- Batch processing
- Memory optimization
- Overflow handling
- Load balancing

### Methods
- Add signal to queue
- Remove signal from queue
- Query queue status
- Configure queue parameters
- Monitor queue metrics

## Queuing Strategies
- Priority-based queuing
- Deadline-based ordering
- Fair queuing
- Weighted fair queuing
- Adaptive queuing

## Usage
Used throughout the system for signal buffering and flow control.
