# RAFTConsensus Class

## Overview
The `RAFTConsensus` class implements the RAFT consensus algorithm for leader election and log replication in the AutoAgents distributed trust system. It provides strong consistency guarantees for distributed state management through a leader-based approach that is simpler to understand and implement than Byzantine consensus protocols.

## Package
`com.IDE.plugin.ai.multiagent.trust.consensus`

## Description
A complete implementation of the RAFT consensus protocol that manages distributed state through leader election, log replication, and safety mechanisms. Designed for environments where nodes may fail (crash-stop model) but are not malicious, providing linearizable consistency for distributed operations.

## Key Features

### Leader-Based Consensus
- Single leader handles all client requests
- Automatic leader election on failures
- Log replication from leader to followers
- Strong consistency through majority consensus

### Fault Tolerance
- Tolerates up to (n-1)/2 node failures
- Automatic leader election and recovery
- Log repair and consistency maintenance
- Network partition resilience

### State Machine Replication
- Ordered log of state changes
- Deterministic state machine execution
- Consistent application of commands
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities

## RAFT Algorithm Components

### Node Roles
```java
private enum NodeRole {
    FOLLOWER,   // Passive nodes that replicate leader's log
    CANDIDATE,  // Nodes seeking election as leader
    LEADER      // Active node handling client requests
}
```

### Persistent State

- **currentTerm**: Latest term server has seen
- **votedFor**: Candidate that received vote in current term
- **log**: Log entries for state machine commands

### Volatile State

- **commitIndex**: Index of highest log entry known to be committed
- **lastApplied**: Index of highest log entry applied to state machine

### Leader-Only Volatile State

- **nextIndex**: For each server, index of next log entry to send
- **matchIndex**: For each server, index of highest log entry known to be replicated

## Timing Parameters

```java
private static final int MIN_ELECTION_TIMEOUT_MS = 150;private static final int MAX_ELECTION_TIMEOUT_MS = 300;private static final int HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS = 50;private static final int RPC_TIMEOUT_MS = 100;
```

## Core Operations

### Command Proposal

### proposeCommand(String command, Map<String, Object> data)

```java
public CompletableFuture<Boolean> proposeCommand(String command, Map<String, Object> data)
```

Proposes a new command to be replicated across the cluster.

**Parameters:**
- `command` - The command to execute
- `data` - Command-specific data

**Returns:** `CompletableFuture<Boolean>` indicating success/failure

**Leader Behavior:**
1. Appends command to local log
2. Replicates entry to followers
3. Commits when majority acknowledges
4. Applies to state machine

**Follower Behavior:**
- Forwards request to current leader
- Returns failure if no leader known

### Message Handling

### handleMessage(RaftMessage message)

```java
public void handleMessage(RaftMessage message)
```

Processes incoming RAFT protocol messages.

**Message Types:**
- **REQUEST_VOTE**: Leader election voting
- **VOTE_RESPONSE**: Response to vote requests
- **APPEND_ENTRIES**: Log replication/heartbeat
- **APPEND_ENTRIES_RESPONSE**: Acknowledgment of log entries

## Leader Election Protocol

### Election Initiation

```java
private void startElection()
```

**Election Process:**
1. Increment current term
2. Vote for self
3. Reset election timer
4. Send RequestVote RPCs to all other nodes
5. Become leader if majority votes received

### Vote Request Handling

```java
private void handleRequestVote(RaftMessage message)
```

**Vote Granting Conditions:**
1. Candidate’s term â‰¥ current term
2. Haven’t voted for another candidate this term
3. Candidate’s log is at least as up-to-date as receiver’s log

**Log Up-to-Date Comparison:**
- Higher term in last log entry wins
- If terms equal, longer log wins

### Leadership Transition

```java
private void becomeLeader()
```

**Leader Initialization:**
1. Set role to LEADER
2. Initialize nextIndex for all followers
3. Send immediate heartbeat
4. Start periodic heartbeat timer

## Log Replication Protocol

### AppendEntries RPC

```java
private void sendAppendEntries(String node)
```

**Purpose:**
- Replicate log entries (when entries present)
- Serve as heartbeat (when no entries)
- Maintain leader authority

**Process:**
1. Determine entries to send based on nextIndex
2. Include previous log entry for consistency check
3. Send AppendEntries RPC
4. Update indices based on response

### Log Consistency Maintenance

```java
private void handleAppendEntries(RaftMessage message)
```

**Consistency Checks:**
1. **Term Check**: Reject if term < currentTerm
2. **Log Consistency**: Verify previous log entry matches
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Remove conflicting entries
4. **Append New Entries**: Add entries not already in log

### Commit Index Management

```java
private void updateCommitIndex()
```

**Commit Rules:**
1. Entry is committed when stored on majority of servers
2. Leader only commits entries from its current term
3. Followers learn of commits through AppendEntries
4. Committed entries are applied to state machine

## Safety Mechanisms

### Election Safety

- At most one leader per term
- Leaders never overwrite existing log entries
- Candidate must have up-to-date log to win election

### Leader Append-Only

- Leaders never delete or overwrite log entries
- Only append new entries to log
- Maintains log consistency across terms

### Log Matching

- If logs contain entry with same index and term, logs are identical in all preceding entries
- Ensured by consistency checks in AppendEntries

### Leader Completeness

- If log entry committed in given term, entry present in logs of all leaders for higher terms
- Guaranteed by election restrictions

### State Machine Safety

- If server has applied log entry at given index, no other server applies different entry for same index

## Message Types and Structures

### RequestVoteRequest

```java
private static class RequestVoteRequest {    private final long term;    private final String candidateId;    private final int lastLogIndex;    private final long lastLogTerm;}
```

### AppendEntriesRequest

```java
private static class AppendEntriesRequest {    private final long term;    private final String leaderId;    private final int prevLogIndex;    private final long prevLogTerm;    private final List<LogEntry> entries;    private final int leaderCommit;}
```

### LogEntry Structure

```java
private static class LogEntry {    private final int index;    private final long term;    private final String command;    private final Map<String, Object> data;    private final Instant timestamp;}
```

## Failure Handling

### Node Failures

- **Leader Failure**: Triggers new election among remaining nodes
- **Follower Failure**: Leader continues with remaining majority
- **Candidate Failure**: Election timeout triggers new election

### Network Partitions

- **Majority Partition**: Continues operation with new leader if needed
- **Minority Partition**: Cannot make progress, waits for partition heal
- **Split-Brain Prevention**: Requires majority for all decisions

### Log Inconsistencies

- **Missing Entries**: Leader sends missing entries to followers
- **Conflicting Entries**: Followers delete conflicting entries and accept leader’s
- **Consistency Repair**: Automatic through normal AppendEntries mechanism

## State Machine Integration

### Command Application

```java
private void applyLogEntry(LogEntry entry)
```

**Application Process:**
1. Execute command against state machine
2. Update lastApplied index
3. Record application results
4. Notify completion for client requests

### State Machine Properties

- **Deterministic**: Same input produces same output
- **Sequential**: Commands applied in log order
- **Idempotent**: Safe to apply same command multiple times

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency

- **Normal Operation**: 1 RTT for command commit
- **Leader Election**: 1-2 election timeouts
- **Log Repair**: Proportional to log divergence

### Throughput

- **Limited by Leader**: Single leader handles all requests
- **Batch Optimization**: Multiple entries per AppendEntries
- **Pipeline Replication**: Overlapping replication requests

### Scalability

- **Read Scaling**: Followers can serve read-only requests
- **Write Scaling**: Limited by leader capacity
- **Cluster Size**: Practical limits due to election overhead

## Usage Examples

### Cluster Initialization

```java
List<String> clusterNodes = Arrays.asList("node-1", "node-2", "node-3", "node-4", "node-5");RAFTConsensus raft = new RAFTConsensus("node-1", clusterNodes);
```

### Command Submission

```java
// Submit command to clusterMap<String, Object> data = Map.of("agentId", "agent-123", "newScore", 0.85);CompletableFuture<Boolean> result = raft.proposeCommand("UPDATE_TRUST_SCORE", data);result.thenAccept(success -> {    if (success) {        System.out.println("Command successfully replicated");    } else {        System.out.println("Command failed or not leader");    }});
```

### Message Processing

```java
// Handle incoming RAFT messageRaftMessage message = new RaftMessage(MessageType.APPEND_ENTRIES, senderId, appendEntriesRequest);raft.handleMessage(message);
```

### Status Monitoring

```java
// Monitor cluster statusSystem.out.println("Current role: " + raft.getCurrentRole());System.out.println("Current leader: " + raft.getCurrentLeader());System.out.println("Current term: " + raft.getCurrentTerm());System.out.println("Commit index: " + raft.getCommitIndex());
