# SignalPersistence

## Overview
Core persistence layer for storing and retrieving mechanical signals with high reliability and performance.

## Purpose
The `SignalPersistence` class provides durable storage capabilities for mechanical signals, ensuring data integrity, efficient retrieval, and long-term archival of signal data.

## Key Components

### Storage Operations
- Signal writing
- Signal reading
- Batch operations
- Transactional support
- Atomic updates

### Storage Features
- Data compression
- Encryption at rest
- Indexing support
- Partitioning strategies
- Replication support

### Query Capabilities
- Time-based queries
- Signal type filtering
- Metadata searches
- Range queries
- Aggregation queries

### Methods
- Store signal
- Retrieve signal
- Query signals
- Delete signals
- Archive signals

## Storage Strategies
- Hot storage for recent signals
- Warm storage for active signals
- Cold storage for archives
- In-memory caching
- Distributed storage

## Usage
Central component for all mechanical signal persistence needs.
