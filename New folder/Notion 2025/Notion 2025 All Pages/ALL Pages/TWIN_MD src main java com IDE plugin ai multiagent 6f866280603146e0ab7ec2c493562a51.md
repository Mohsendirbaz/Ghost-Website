## Overview
Integration layer for connecting the multi-agent system with Claude Code AI services.

## Purpose
The `ClaudeCodeIntegration` class provides seamless integration between the local multi-agent system and Claude Code's AI capabilities, enabling agents to leverage advanced AI features.

## Key Components

### Integration Features
- API connection management
- Request/response handling
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Error handling and retry logic

### Communication Layer
- HTTP/HTTPS client configuration
- Request serialization
- Response deserialization
- Stream handling for long responses
- Connection pooling

### Data Transformation
- Task to Claude request mapping
- Claude response to task result mapping
- Context preservation
- Token management

### Methods
- Initialize connection
- Send request to Claude
- Process Claude response
- Handle streaming responses
- Manage session state

## Integration Patterns
- Synchronous requests
- Asynchronous requests
- Streaming responses
- Batch processing
- Conversation management

## Usage
Used by agents that need to leverage Claude's AI capabilities for task execution.
